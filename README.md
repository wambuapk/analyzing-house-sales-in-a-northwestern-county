# Analyzing House Sales in King County: A Multiple Linear Regression Approach

## Overview
Nyika Developers, a customer-centric real estate agency, has recognized the importance of providing accurate and data-driven insights on property values to empower homeowners. To meet this need, they have commissioned a project to analyze house sales in King County using multiple linear regression modeling. This approach enables a thorough examination of factors that influence sale prices, allowing Nyika Developers to offer informed guidance to homeowners. By identifying the relationships between these factors and sale prices, homeowners can make informed decisions to maximize their homes' value and explore long-term investment opportunities.

## Statement of the Problem
Nyika Developers aims to provide accurate and data-driven advice to homeowners regarding the impact of renovations on property value. Through comprehensive analysis of house sales data using multiple linear regression modeling, they seek to identify key features influencing sale prices and assess the impact of location. This knowledge will guide their construction plans, pricing strategies, and investments to maximize profitability in King County's real estate market.

## Data Understanding
For this project, we are utilizing  datasets to analyze house sales and provide insights on home renovations. These datasets contain information about individual homes within King County, including features like price, square footage, address, and other relevant details.

## Success Metrics
We will use R-squared and MAE to meet 2 objectives:
- R-squared helps asses model improvements in prediction variation in house prices.
- Mean Absolute Error helps us to measure the distance of the predicted prices from the actual prices.

## Conclusions
1. Significant predictors of house prices include variables such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, floors, and the condition of the house.
2. Quarter of sales also has a small but noticeable effect on house prices.
3. The developed regression models explain approximately 60.8% of the variance in house prices.
4. Limitations include the absence of location-specific and external economic factors.

## Recommendations
1. Emphasize important features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage when pricing properties or advising on renovations.
2. Highlight desirable locations and unique aspects of each region to attract buyers.
3. Consider property condition and view, showcasing positive aspects to potential buyers.
4. Include additional factors like neighborhood characteristics and market trends for more accurate pricing recommendations.
5. Engage in continued research, refinement, and updating of models to stay current with market dynamics.

Implementing these recommendations will enable Nyika Developers to accurately price properties, effectively market them, and provide valuable insights to clients, maximizing property value and facilitating successful transactions.
